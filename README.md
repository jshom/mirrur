**Hack RPI Fall 2019 x Project Mirror**
Assisted Journalling with NLP for Mental Health

Wolfram Award Winner ðŸŽ‰

## Goal
Help pre-depressive/hopeless behaviors through customized supportive messaging and, if necessary, provide a report to share with health care professional to find inflection points.

With data coming from a text as an anonymous shared journalling platform, we collected natural language from users from text messages and responded with proper texts in accordance with their hopelessness index (0-1). At lower levels, we referred users to mental health specialists with an online anonymous report they could access. This report offered the ability to find changes in hopelessness over time.

**NLP Heuristics (Averaged for hopelessness index)**
- Absolutism/Polarization Index (0-1 Index for usage of words like "always", "never", "completely")
- Global Sentiment (0-1 Positivity Word Values Summed and mapped to 0-1 score)
- Last Entry Sentiment (Same as Global Sentiment but just for latest entry to weight the present)

*Note: Polarization was found to be highly predictive of hopeless behavior, for this reason we made sure to focus our efforts on here. It was a challenge weighting the index based on the amount of these determiners, adjectives and adverbs relative to the total count of these parts of speech in the body of text*

## Tools & Technologies
